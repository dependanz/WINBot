Welcome to WINBot's documentation!
==================================
WINBot is a discord bot with features directed towards discord guilds for WIN churches (Word International Ministries).

This bot has two main goals: 

1. Features should have the primary motivation to bring people closer together in a guild.
2. Make it simple to add commands for both admin and developers.

Both goals are expounded upon here :ref:`<insert here>`. 

**Admins:** To start the bot as an admin go to :ref:`<insert here>`. 

**Developers:** To start the bot as a developer go to :ref:`<insert here>`. 

Definitions
-----------
As the primary author of the bot is an advocate for systematicity, the following are definitions of notions frequently used in this documentation:

1. **Feature**

   A feature :math:`\mathcal{F}_{<feature\_name>}`, is a set of (not-necessarily simple) functions whose membership in :math:`\mathcal{F}_{<feature\_name>}` 
   means the function does something related to the definition of <feature_name>

2. **Verification Layers**

   Despite the primary author's dislike of python as a language, one main paradigm of the code in WINBot is very pythonic: **decorators**. 
   Developers of WINBot must use verification function decorators for all functions called from the client.

   A tutorial on verification layers are here :ref:`<insert here>`
